# MScProject
This repository includes the codes I used in my dissertation.

In the project, a model designed to simulate the choice reaching task (CRT) experiments of Song and Nakayama(2008). The model is based on the dynamic field theory (DFT) and designed by using the COSIVINA framework. Some elements of the COSIVINA are modified and some elements are added to meet the requirements of the model. These elements can be found in this repository but for more information about the COSIVINA and DFT please visit https://github.com/sschneegans/cosivina and https://dynamicfieldtheory.org/.

More information about the project can be found in my thesis. Once I submitted I will share here as well.
