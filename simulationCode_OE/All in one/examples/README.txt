INTRODUCTION

This folder contains examples of dynamic neural field simulators that illustrate the functions and capabilities of the COSIVINA toolbox and provide a tool to learn about dynamic field theory. The files exampleA, exampleB, and exampleC accompany the corresponding sections in the documentation. The launcher files each create a basic neural field architecture as well as a matching GUI and run this GUI.

To run the examples, call the setpath function in the COSIVINA folder (or manually add the folder and its subfolders to the Matlab path) and then call one of the launcher files from the Matlab command window. The simulation starts immediately and runs continuously until you quit the GUI. Plots display the current activation states of the dynamic fields in each architecture. Sliders and controls allow you to set inputs or change connection strengths and other parameters of the architecture. The parameter button will open a new window that allows you to access all parameters of the architecture. Hover with the mouse over control elements to see a description of the control.

The one-dimensional plots of dynamic neural fields typically show the following components: The field activation (blue), the field output (red), and external inputs to the field (green). Image plots show field activation or field output as color code, with dark blue corresponding to lowest, dark red to highest activation.


OVERVIEW OVER PROVIDED DNF ARCHITECTURES

launcherTwoNeuronSimulator: Simulates two discrete dynamic nodes (or neurons) that can receive inputs and be coupled to each other in an excitatory or inhibitory fashion. Shows the attractor and repellor states for each individual neuron and the rates of change for all possible activation states. Can be used to illustrate detection, selection, or working memory in a discrete system (without a continuous feature space), or to model a neural oscillator.

launcherOneLayerField: Simulates the most basic dynamic field architecture, a single one-dimensional field with lateral interactions that receives external inputs. The GUI shows the dynamic field in the top plot and the interaction kernel in the bottom plot. Use sliders to set inputs and change interactions parameters. You can observe detection instability, selection between inputs, and self-sustained peaks in this model.

launcherOneLayerField_preset: Same as launcherOneLayerField, but with predefined interaction patterns. Choose a pattern from the dropdown menu, then click Select to activate the chosen pattern (this re-initializes the simulation). 

launcherOneLayerField_runningHistory: Same launcherOneLayerField, but shows a running history of field activations in the bottom plot.

launcherOneLayerFieldMemoryTrace: Creates a single one-dimensional dynamic field with a memory trace. The memory trace slowly builds up activation at supra-threshold locations in the field and projects back to it. This can be used as a long-term memory mechanism.

launcherOneLayerField2D: Creates a two-dimensional neural field with lateral interaction that can receive localized or ridge inputs. Can be used to illustrate stabilized detection, selection and sustained peaks in two-dimensions, and to show selection through ridge inputs or peak formation from intersections of ridges.

launcherOneLayerField2D_surfacePlot: Same as launcherOneLayerField2D, but with three-dimensional surface plot of the field activation.

launcherTwoLayerField: Model with separate excitatory (field u, top) and inhibitory layer (field v, bottom). The excitatory layer receives external inputs and can excite itself and the inhibitory layer. The inhibitory layer projects inhibition back to the excitatory layer.

launcherTwoLayerField_preset: Same as launcherTwoLayerField, but with pre-defined interactions patterns that can be selected from the dropdown menu.

launcherThreeLayerField: Model with two excitatory layers (field u and field w) and a shared inhibitory layer (field v). Can be used to implement a change detection model, in which field w serves as working memory and field and field u as contrast field. The contrast field form a peak only when a novel stimulus is presented.

launcherAttractorDynamics: Demonstrates the attractor dynamics approach for controlling the orientation of a mobile robot for target acquisition. A neural field is coupled to a uniquely instantiated dynamic variable, reflecting robot heading direction. Peaks in the field set attractors for the dynamic variable.

launcherCoupling: Creates an architecture of two one-dimensional fields, coupled to the different dimensions of a single two-dimensional field. Can be used to illustrate extraction of lower-dimensional information from a higher-dimensional representation, selection by ridge inputs (e.g. for visual search), and the binding problem (see DFT book, Chapter 5).

launcherCoupling3D: Demonstrates the same effects as launcherCoupling, but now using a three-dimensional field (with two spatial dimensions and one feature dimension).

launcherDCCS: Dynamic field model of the Dimensional Change Card Sort task (see DFT book, Chapter 14).

launcherImageGrabber: Demonstrates generation of field input from actual image data. Loads image from file, performs a color extraction/classification and summation over the vertical dimension, and feeds the result as input into a stack of three one-dimensional fields, one for each extracted color channel.

launcherLabelFeatureAssociation: Dynamic field model of word learning, using memory trace to create assciations between visual features and verbal object labels (see DFT book, Chapter 13).

launcherLookingModel: Dynamic field model of the development of looking behavior (see DFT book, Chapter 12).

launcherOrdinalDynamics: Dynamic node architecture to generate a seqeuence of actions (see DFT book, Chapter 10).

launcherRobotSimulator: Uses the attractor dynamics approach to control a simulated mobile robot in an arena, performing taxis or avoidance behavior with respect to sensor targets (see DFT book, Chapter 4).

launcherSceneRepresentation: Dynamic field model of visual scene representation in working memory (see DFT book, Chapter 8).

launcherTransformation: Creates a model that implements a variable shift of the representation in a field, e.g. for reference frame transformations (see DFT book, Chapter 7). Can be used for forward transformation, backward transformation, or pattern match. Sliders only control inputs to the model, connection strengths have to be set via parameter panel.
